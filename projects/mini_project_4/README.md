#### Description:
Based on the 1.0 version, the 2.0 version creates three clones of the page centent and lets them scroll in turn when one scrolls down the page.

From version 2.0, I want to make a 3.0 version that when the page is scrolled down and rotating at the same time, the content that is matching to the orginal scrolling position (before the bug extension) will also show up in the window, at the propoer position.
