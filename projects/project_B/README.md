# Project B:

## Intro:

Words constitutes sentences; sentences constitutes paragraphy. Sometimes it feels like playing an LEGO game when we look at the way a text is formed.

As an English learner, when we encounter unfamiliar words while readingï¼Œwe are always told to "guess the meaning of the words from context". It works in most canses, but it also makes us question: What does words means to us readers?
Do you actually unserstand each word you read? How do we percive words and to what extent, does words matter to a language?

This extention serves as an experiment on text, and proposes an challenge to your reading habbit on digital platform: by asking for the longest word you can remember, it playes a trick and changes all the words on the website that has the same length as your input words. Don't worry, it just changes the looking!(For example, google --> goofy).
Now read the new version text you have, does it still make sense? can you still try to "guess the meaning of the words from context"?

The result will fully depends on individual. Maybe you will find it funny, maybe you will find it annoying. By inserting a brake that interferes with the user's reading routines, this extention examines the expression of language and challenges the fast reading habits on a digital platform, where individual elements of the digital content are often overlooked while fast-browsing.

Challenge taken? Now insert this extention to this wesite: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~spok/grimmtmp/009.txt
and let's see what happens!

## TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
This project has gone through quite a lot technical  challenges, and still has a lot to be improved.

1. Word search API that find similar-looking words

It was not easy to find an API just does exactly what we want: find words that just looks similar. Most API we found served as an dictionary. Luckily, we finally found this words API who can deal with different modifications to words:https://www.datamuse.com/api/ and got the replace words we want.

2. Limitation of the API

We realized the API can only search with  words longer than 4 characters, which made us to rethink on our narrative. We added a sentence to our narrative that somehow indicates the user they can do better than the word "monkey", for example,  so that we can avoid users inputting words with less than four characters.

3. Replace orginal words with words from the API dataset and have it work on all website.

As we are not directly searching inputed words from API but intead using all the words on the website that have the same length as the inputed word, we first need to collect all those words from the website. We tried to take all the text from the website, split and join, and replace all the innerHTML of the website, but we only get to make it fucntion on pages that only have texts, otherwise it will change the whole layout of the page. This will be the main improvement we want to have to make it work on a ranome website.
