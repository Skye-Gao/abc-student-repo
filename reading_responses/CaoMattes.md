Both Eva and Franco Mattes’ projects and Cao Fei’s Second Life take internet as a space that mirrors or even refracts people’s activities in real life. At first glance, Cao Fei’s work gives me an expression that it is almost like a game or a playground where people can just mess around with their imagination. It is playful, fictional, but at the same time speculative and even uncanny. Just like many other games, users of Second life building their own worlds, creating avatars and setting their own rules of communication with other users. However, Cao Fei’s work consider those user activities not merely as a virtual expression of users’ self-imaginary world, but a carrier of societal and cultural presence. RMB city, as analyzed in the article, can be viewed a reflection of China’s rapid urbanization and its contemporary consumer culture. Every single appearance of RMB city can find its corresponding existence in real world, but carries a meaning that is beyond its presence. While the Second Life, as an Internet space, gives user almost ultimate freedom to create their own fantasy land, those repeated, metaphoric visual language also indicates that it is almost impossible to escape the world we are in.  

While Cao Fei’s work tried to discover a free world by reforming Internet space, Eva and Franco Mattes’ projects express their concern towards the potentially unconstrained capability of a internet space. By completely get rid of the bars of internet communication channels, the concept of “life sharing” suddenly becomes jarring, as the boundary between publicity and privacy turned out to be fragile. It is actually funny to see how privacy is valued only when we cannot defend our privacy. I find this project actually challenges the original intention of Internet as a shared space, and reveal the reality that internet, as an ideally open sphere, might never be transparent.
