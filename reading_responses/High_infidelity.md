McLuhan states in his theory of "Technology as Extension of Human Body” that an extension of our body/sense occurs when the reach of our embodies mind is extended beyond our natural means. I find such depiction highly analogous to our case of virtual identities. The digital media provides people with a land where a new, created “self” beyond our biological existence can live, following with new forms of communication and connection. The question is, can we create our virtual selves purely based on our visions, or is it some reflection of our existing beings? And furthermore, can the virtual selves take the place of our physical existence?

The article argues that the virtual world and the real world are two correlated dimension of our existence, they all together constitute our perception of reality and visions. The virtual identity is not what we born with, like our biological body, but something we can create, modify, and manipulate to create a vision we. But just as human created God according to the image of their own, our vision of out “new” identify is always shadowed by our experience in real life. One can argue that the virtual life can have nothing resemble to our real life, like in the case of Julie, where the avatar’s identity is entirely different to the reality, which brings out the term of infidelity. However, if we do not just look at the appearance of the virtual life, but at its intention and influence, we will find it actually provide us a perspective to look back at our real life.

As McLuhan states that “Every extension of mankind, especially technological extensions, has the effect of amputating or modifying some other extension…”, virtual body can says a lot not only about our biological body, but also about our inner state of mind. Also in the case of Julie, while some sees it as a betrayal to his true identity, this can rather be a sign of looking for sense of identity in online world. After all, the two existence, the virtual and physical ones, altogether completes one’s identity.
