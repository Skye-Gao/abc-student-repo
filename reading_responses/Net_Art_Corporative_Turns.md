Though many of us have already been embedded with the prophetic knowledge that media is itself apart of art expression, it is still freshening to learn about how the transformation from “content is king” to “context is king” had taken place with net arts since the late 1990s. During that time, the pervasion of capitalization and consumeristic practice has brought significant changes to the expression of internet space. Contents driven by commercialization were increasingly infusing online platforms, and an alienation of identity can be observed in such a system that has been corporative-controlled. Willingly or critically, the net artists took a novel expression as response to such internet trend, which was also interpreted as “Net art’s corporative turns” in the article.

Before reading the article, I was already impressed by how the concept of commercialization could be involved in net arts that are concerning political/social issues, and my understanding were furthered by learning the historical context from the article. Projects such as Blackness for Sale and The Interaction of Colors, both created by Mendi and Keith Obadike, are perfect examples to demonstrate how the same topic of racism/colorism can be augmented through the different language of internet. As descripted in its profile, Blackness for Sale “draws a connection between the commodification of black bodies during American slavery and the commodification of blackness on the internet”. On the one hand, it seems that by attaching marketing value, the underlying discrimination towards blackness was diminished through the seemly fair proposition of value; on the other hand, the commodification of identity can also provide potential space for further racism by simply manifesting the marked value. It is especially ironic to see that, eBay censored the marketing of race identity and interpreted it as “inappropriateness.”, and how such censorship revealed by itself the discriminating nature of capitalism. By articulating that “The listing separated Keith’s blackness from his body, highlighting the absurdity of notions of the internet as a place to try on different identities and avatars unrelated to one’s lived experience.”, the project also demonstrated the alienation of one’s identity in a society where marketing value was beyond morality, and such phenomenon is still present in today’s internet space.
