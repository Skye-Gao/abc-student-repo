Response to Online Intimacy Readings

Internet adds another layer to our interpersonal relationship. While the digital identity and the interpersonal relationship extended from such identity often understood as unidentical to real ones, they have become integral to modern people whose social connections have been constantly transferred to a digitized space. Like in Gene McHugh's writing, our generation, which is described as “digital natives”, takes connection through screen as a natural practice to establish relationships and further intimacy. We do not consider why, but rather simply think about how. 

A new language is introduced by digital technology about perception and expression of emotion, and interpersonal relationship. We “like” to show affection, we look through other’s timeline to know one person, and we send out messages to get confirmation. The internal drive force inside us that pushes to find or even create ways to affirm intimacy through internet practice is so strong, sometimes we overlooked the intertwined connection digital relationship has with the real, physical one. The realization that how intimacy is transformed through the language of internet often doesn’t come during the time we are busy experiencing those relationships, but can strike us when lost takes place. Like Claire Evans describes in her article, the dissolve of online relationship makes us aware of the certain practices, language, and norms we have utilized to form relationship is an addition added by the internet. When we un-do, we realize what we did. It is like when we are looking at the time flying back, and experience all the once maybe flattened emotion again, but in a shoes of an out-sider. Her description of how the relationships is dissolved through internet practice reminds me of the net art work of Sarah Hallacher “User Experience of a Heartbreak”. Through, a series of illustrations and animations documenting how our use of technology can be reflected through lost of love, it shows that the language we have leant to create intimacy.
