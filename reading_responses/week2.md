The perspective Lialina took for her research is very interesting as she distinguish the web user as “professional” and “amateur”, and used their aesthetic preference towards web page to analyze the trend and transformation of vernacular web.

It is quite intriguing to look at her views about the aesthetic trends in the 90’s to early 21st century from almost 20 years later. While she talked about all those newly-emergered features as if it is the representative of new and near future, those features are mostly considered “outdated” by now. The translucency, the “glossy round edged style”, the all-pervading sparkling glitters, even at her time, Lialina had realized the underlying implication of all those webpage design and vernacular aesthetics. As she argues, it is “(A)t the expense of usability, pages acquire a haunted, immaterial look.” The contradict is still existing even now. While the minimalist, text-free style is definitely a sign of modern and concise at this time, people also argue that the style fails at many occasions to convey the functionality efficiently. For example, it is extremely hard for the elderly to understand all the icons. For them, it is almost a new language.

The shifted focus from a webpage’s functionality to its visual information, which now has been put on a lot of emphasis as “user experience”, is raising the question that who will take the webpage one step further? Are they professionals that devoted to explore the universe of the technology, or the “amateur” who devoted to a wider acceptance of the usage of Web?
